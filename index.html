  <h1>BAGASKI<h1>
  <h2>A Graphic Designer, Front End Developer & Creative Coder Wannabe</h2>
  <p>My Name is Bagaski and officially I am a Graphic Designer. I developed an interest in Web Design and through that in Front End Development. I worked with Web Developers while employed in Digital Agencies in London and in Greece. I started learning HTML and CSS on my own. I also started using sound and producing electronic music and I reallised that I could use programming creatively into my muisic productions. I tried Pure Data and Super Collider. I decided that I want to take my programming skills further and spend more time to practise and become a front end developer and but also a more advanced creative coder.</p>
